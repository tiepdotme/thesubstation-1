The SUBSTATION is one of Melbourneâ€™s most exciting and exclusive events spaces. Even though we might be exclusive, we are entirely inclusive. We support any marriage and have a venue that lends itself to limitless creative opportunities.

The SUBSTATION can accommodate weddings from around 80 to a maximum of 200 guests. We can help you create your perfect event whether it be a seated dinner, cocktail party or ceremony.

We are now taking bookings for 2019. Get in touch to secure a date.

We receive a large number of enquiries for weddings at our venue. The SUBSTATION presents an annual curated arts program and bookings are scheduled around this program.
