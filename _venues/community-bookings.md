The SUBSTATION is dedicated to working with the local community through venue hire. The SUBSTATION has a number of hires each year allocated to community bookings. Community bookings provide opportunities for The Substation to engage in activities within their community. 

If you are a local not for profit or community organisation please send through your event proposal including dates, number of guests and the reason for your event to Marisa Fiume on events@thesubstation.org.au
