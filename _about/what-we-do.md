The SUBSTATION is a not-for-profit multi arts centre located in a 100-year-old repurposed, industrial building. 

The SUBSTATION presents an annual curated program of creative development, residencies and presentation. Engaging with artists from across artistic disciplines, working in non-traditional modes and across art-forms, The SUBSTATION provides the opportunity for artists and audiences to connect with our unique space and the distinctive location of Newport.

Reflecting the broader history of Melbourne’s inner west, we encourage artists to engage with our post-industrial space where we foster a culture of interconnectedness, collaboration and independence, and where we value new ideas, imagination and difference.

Here's our most recent Annual Reports:
