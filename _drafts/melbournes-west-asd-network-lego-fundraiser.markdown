[Melbourne’s West ASD Network](https://www.mwasdnetwork.org/events/lego-exhibition-the-substation/) was founded by a mother of three, Jody, at the start of 2017. Jody created MWASD to bring together families, carers, therapists, friends and more of amazing kids on the spectrum in Melbourne's Western suburbs. In 2018, Melbourne’s West ASD Network held their first ever Lego Exhibition Fundraiser at The SUBSTATION.
