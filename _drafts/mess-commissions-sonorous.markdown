The [MESS](https://mess.foundation/) Commissions will allow audiences to experience the expansive range of electronic sound that is created in Australia in an environment conducive to deep immersive listening. From engaging emerging artists to create new work to presenting pieces by established practitioners, through to bringing light to the vast and mostly unheard work created in this country since the late 1960s’, the MESS Commissions aims to support and expose the significant culture of electronic sound that exists in Australia.

Rosalind Hall’s spatial and expansive work explores the physicality of sound through the use of amplification, microtonal movement, beat frequencies and reverberation. Derived from acoustic and electronic sources, she seeks to extend these materials by sampling and processing to create pieces that evoke a sense of claustrophobic infinity.

Since the early 1980s’ Steve Law has been walking a unique path through electronic sound. From renowned techno project Zen Paradox through to his reputation as an improviser and experimenter with live electronics, Steve has quietly built a reputation as one of Australia’s great electronic sound artists. His career has seen him release many recordings and play countless shows here in Australia and overseas as well as receive significant recognition for his work. Steve received the inaugural ABC Classic FM computer music award in 1996 and was named best live electronic act at the Australian Live Music Awards in 2000.

This project is supported by Creative Victoria through VicArts. MESS is supported by our members and donor supporters, Australia Council for the Arts, The City of Melbourne and Creative Spaces.
