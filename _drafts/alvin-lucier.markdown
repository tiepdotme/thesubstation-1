To celebrate the release of the [AUSTRALIAN ART ORCHESTRA](http://aao.com.au) commissioned work, Swing Bridge by ALVIN LUCIER, we’re hosting a listening party and special performance at The SUBSTATION.

In 2015, the AUSTRALIAN ART ORCHESTRA commissioned legendary American composer ALVIN LUCIER to write a new work for the AAO using the Melbourne Town Hall Organ. The resulting work, Swing Bridge will be released on New York-based label, [MODE RECORDS](https://moderecords.bandcamp.com/).

The listening party will feature a live remix of the record by experimental turntable artist and frequent AAO collaborator, MARTIN NG, alongside a live iteration of the iconic installation work, Music on a Long Thin Wire, by ALVIN LUCIER.

We’ll also have a special gin-based cocktail made for the launch: I Am Drinking In A Room, which will be free with purchase of the album.

Swing Bridge will be released on limited edition vinyl and will also feature another as yet unreleased ALVIN LUCIER work, Sizzles. Sizzles was composed in 1997 for organ and resonating percussion and recorded in the Melbourne Town Hall in the middle of the night, so that the ambient sounds of the city were at their quietest.

This project has been assisted by the Australian Government through the [Australia Council for the Arts](https://www.australiacouncil.gov.au/), its funding and advisory body. This event is also supported by [Creative Victoria](https://creative.vic.gov.au/), the City of Melbourne Arts Grants Program, and [Ensemble Offspring](http://ensembleoffspring.com/).
