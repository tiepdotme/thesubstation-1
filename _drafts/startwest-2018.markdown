The [#StartWest](https://www.startwest.org/) initiative supports strong community building in Melbourneâ€™s West through startup support and monthly networking opportunities across four council districts: Wyndham, Hobsons Bay, Moonee Valley and Maribrynong. The SUBSTATION hosted a one day event in July of 2018 dedicated to connecting and inspiring entrepreneurs in Melbourne's West as apart of the #StartWest campaign.
