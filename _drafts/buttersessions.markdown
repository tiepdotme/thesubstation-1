The past few years, we've watched from afar as Tokyo based DJ Haruka has established himself as one of Japan's top DJs and a crucial figure in the dance music scene. Landing himself sets at top tier events around Europe and Japan, including the renowned Labyrinth Festival. Since inviting him to play in Melbourne in 2018 and catching him multiple times in Japan, our online curiosities were met in real life with his impeccable taste and personalised style of house and techno.

We're now thrilled to invite Haruka back to Melbourne to play the Substation ahead of the release of his debut EP on Butter Sessions.

The "Senko" EP encapsulates everything we loved about his DJ sets - hypnotic, bold and acidic synth sequences paired with masterful live percussion and drumming from Izpon (of Japanese salsa band Banderas) and Shigekazu Otake (of cult group Cro-Magnon) to create a unique sonic space. The recordings snarling nature rejects the pure force of DJ Nobu's Future Terror crew, of which Haruka is a key member.

Supported by a live set by Tarquin Manek & Y-L Hooi and DJ sets from Sleep D and Jess Sneddon.
