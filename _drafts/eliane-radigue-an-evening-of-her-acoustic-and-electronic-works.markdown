French composer Éliane Radigue holds a unique place in electronic music history. Her works, created for Arp 2500 synthesiser, are renowned for their hypnotic pulsing, reductive beauty and deep timbral palettes. Over the course of nearly five decades, Radigue set a benchmark for minimalist electronic music and struck the tone for generations to come. More recently she has turned her ears to acoustic sources, working closely with a select group of musicians to create works that share the intense focus and beauty of her earlier pieces. To celebrate her work, Lionel Marchetti, Cat Hope, Decibel, and Lawrence English come together to present an evening of electronic music diffusions and delicate acoustics.

Presented by The SUBSTATION and Room40.
