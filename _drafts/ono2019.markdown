ONO is Melbourneâ€™s central space for experimental and ambient music, opening dialogue between imagination, comfort and deep listening.

The third iteration of ONO at The SUBSTATION explores the aesthetics of care, urging positive associations between audience, room and artist. ONO creates an environment where vulnerability is supported, allowing receptance of an intense musical output. Focusing on flexible and psychedelic performances, both the artist and the audience can journey into outer sound. 

In 2019 ONO brings together Grand River (ITA), Chris SSG, Fia Fiell and Soft-High (aka. Sleep D).

ONO lays a platform for artists less heard in Australia, growing the space where these undercurrents in music are appreciated. 

Previous guests include Burnt Freidman, Kuniyuki Takahashi, Bee Mask, Nuel & Sleep D
