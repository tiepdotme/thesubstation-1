Journeying towards a collective understanding of rhythm and sound, [ONO](https://www.o-n-o.com.au/) returns for their third instalment at The SUBSTATION. 

Part performance, part installation, ONO creates a platform for the music we usually reserve for private consumption. By making the conditions of warmth and intimacy communal, ambient and experimental sounds flow freely.

Often intense but always rewarding, room, artist and audience all form part of the instrument.

In 2019 ONO brings together [GRAND RIVER](https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/grandriver-de) live, Spazio Disponibile/One Instrument (ITA/NL), 
[CHRIS SSG](https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/chrismnmlssgs/biography), MNML SSGS (JPN), 
[FÍA FIELL](https://bodypromise.bandcamp.com/track/fia-fiell-ladder), Nice Music/Body Promise
[SOFT HIGH aka. Sleep D](https://sleep-d.bandcamp.com/) (Butter Sessions)

[ONO](https://www.o-n-o.com.au/) lays a platform for artists less heard in Australia, growing the space where these undercurrents in music are appreciated.
