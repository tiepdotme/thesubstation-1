Continuing the journey towards a collective understanding of rhythm and sound, [ONO](https://www.o-n-o.com.au/) returns for their third instalment at The SUBSTATION. 

Pack a cushion, or grab one provided and snuggle down for a night of high fidelity storytelling.

Part performance, part installation, ONO creates a platform for music most often reserved for private enjoyment. Ambient and experimental sounds flow freely via communal conditions of warmth, comfort and intimacy between listener and performer.

**[GRAND RIVER]**(https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/grandriver-de) live, Spazio Disponibile/One Instrument (ITA/NL)

**[CHRIS SSG]**(https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/chrismnmlssgs/biography), MNML SSGS (JPN)
<br>

**[FÍA FIELL]**(https://bodypromise.bandcamp.com/track/fia-fiell-ladder), Nice Music/Body Promise 
<br>

**[SOFT HIGH aka. Sleep D]**(https://sleep-d.bandcamp.com/)(Butter Sessions)
<br>

Often intense but always rewarding, room, artist and audience all form part of the instrument. 

**[ONO]**(https://www.o-n-o.com.au/) lays a platform for artists less heard in Australia, growing the space where these undercurrents in music are appreciated.
