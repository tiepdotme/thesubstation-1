Continuing the journey towards a collective understanding of rhythm and sound, [ONO](https://www.o-n-o.com.au/) returns for their third instalment at The SUBSTATION. 

Pack a cushion, or grab one provided and snuggle down for a night of high fidelity storytelling.

Part performance, part installation, ONO creates a platform for music most often reserved for private enjoyment. Ambient and experimental sounds flow freely via communal conditions of warmth, comfort and intimacy between listener and performer.

Often intense but always rewarding, room, artist and audience all form part of the instrument.
