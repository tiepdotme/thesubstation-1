The SUBSTATION presents the Melbourne premiere of [BROOK ANDREW](http://www.brookandrew.com)’s major installation THE CELL. Decorated in Wiradjuri patterns and inviting audience participation, THE CELL is a jumping castle of sorts, that blurs the lines between sanctuary and detention. 

ANDREW's work examines Western history, specifically relating to colonialism, and places Australia at the centre of a global inquisition, spanning across video, sculpture, photography and immersive installations.

Presented by The SUBSTATION and BROOK ANDREW.
