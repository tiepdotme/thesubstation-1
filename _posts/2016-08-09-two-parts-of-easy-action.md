TWO PARTS OF EASY ACTION is a solo work choreographed and performed by DEANNE BUTTERWORTH with critically acclaimed, experimental musician EVELYN MORRIS.  It examines the vulnerability and power of the solo performer using dance and music. Occurring in two parts, one old and one new, DEANNE revisits a work shown at NGV for Melbourne Now in 2014 where she performed with EVELYN in a gallery displaying eighteenth century paintings. The new part is a performance involving a guitar. She is a dancer, not a musician.

At the heart of this work, she seeks to unearth a particular performance language using a known and an unfamiliar form. She reinvents the mundane, through exploring repetition in action and sound while conjuring rhythms and undercurrents of energy.

TWO PARTS OF EASY ACTION is devised for the cavernous SUBSTATION, working with the existing energy of the space to add a dynamic physical and sonic presence.

## The Artists

**DEANNE BUTTERWORTH.** Performing in the work of dance and other artists, her choreographic practice focuses on collaboration and working in outdoor spaces. Among others she has worked with SHELLEY LASICA, Danceworks Company & Sandra Parker Dance, JO LLOYD, and Phillip Adams BalletLab. Her works have been presented and supported by Dancehouse, Dance New Amsterdam (NYC), Lucy Guerin Inc., Melbourne Fringe, Melbourne Festival, Next Wave Festival, Dance Massive, West Space, Arup, Critical Path and National Gallery of Victoria. In 2012 BUTTERWORTH collaborated with artist LINDA TEGG to create a site specific work at a convenience store. In 2014 BUTTERWORTH performed Regarding Yesterday, by Brussels based choreographer, ADVA ZAKAI. She performed Intermission (MARIA HASSABI) and Defending Plural Experiences, (ALICIA FRANKOVICH), both at ACCA; she also performed Entitled Title, (Keir Choreographic Award). During 2015/16 Deanne performed in Solos For Other People by Lasica (Dance Massive 15); worked with Lasica and JO LLOYD (How Choreography Works, West Space); developed new works with LEE SERLE, SHIAN LAW, TIM DARBYSHIRE, and began two new works- Re-enactments located outdoors, Easy Action a work for dancer and guitar and Interlude for Spring 1883 at The Windsor Hotel. Most recently she performed in work by BELLE BASSIN, (Heide MOMA), and at AGNSW for the Biennale of Sydney Public Program.

**EVELYN MORRIS** has had a musical career with a great deal of variety. Starting out as a punk/thrash drummer in bands such as True Radical Miracle and art-rock group Baseball MORRIS travelled all over the world performing loud and intricate beats. Baseball travelled to Japan, Taiwan, and all over Europe. Whilst there MORRIS met up with DARREN HANLON and continued to tour playing drums and singing with him in Europe - and then for several tours in Australia. Not content with just drums, in amidst all this she started her own musical project called Pikelet. Pikelet has released three full-length albums and several EPs, all received great critical acclaim, and MORRIS travelled around The States and Europe performing. Pikelet has appeared several times at festivals such as Golden Plains, Melbourne International Arts Festival and supported a wide range of international artists such as Sufjan Stevens, Goldfrapp, Devendra Banhart and many more.

In 2014 EVELYN MORRIS was awarded The Age Music Victoria award for best experimental/avant garde act, nominated and voted for by her esteemed peers in the field.  Recently MORRIS started the LISTEN group, a community effort at creating discourse and documenting the history around women's involvement in music in Australia. This project has created great changes within the musical communities in Melbourne and continues to grow and influence the way music is utilized in Australia.
