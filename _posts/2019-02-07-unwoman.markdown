Unwoman is song.
Unwoman is a crime.
Unwoman is a real and substantial risk.

UNWOMAN is an epic and imagistic piece of feminist theatre created in both Ireland and Australia, examining reproductive rights, experiences of pregnancy and bodily autonomy. 

Made with THE RABBLE, professional performers and a community ensemble of pregnant performers, UNWOMAN is an invocation of the pregnant body as a plurality of experiences. It is visceral, carnal and an uncompromising piece of feminist theatre horrified by the history and laws attempting to curb bodily autonomy and reproductive rights.

UNWOMAN Part III was co-created with Maeve Stone in Dublin 2018.

UNWOMAN is presented by The SUBSTATION and Due West with support of Hobsons Bay Council. This project has been assisted by the Australian Government through the Australia Council, its arts funding and advisory body. Unwoman Part III was created with Maeve Stone featuring Olwen Fouere and was developed at FRINGE LAB with commissioning support from Dublin Fringe Festival and producing support from Pan Pan Theatre.
