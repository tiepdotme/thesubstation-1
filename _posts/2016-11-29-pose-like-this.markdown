Recent VCA graduates, [EMMA COLLARD](http://cargocollective.com/emmacollard/) and [RAFAELLA MCDONALD](http://rafaellamcdonald.com.au), collaborate in their first major exhibition together, POSE LIKE THIS. Developing the work in The SUBSTATION’s galleries, a series of sets for performances spill throughout the space. Utilising materials such as brightly-coloured paint, wood, plastic, mirrors, fabric and found objects, the duo create a range of overlapping environments, intermingled with pre-recorded videos, live recordings, performances and bodily improvisations. Reflecting on various representations of the body, self and the frame, the large network of images and actions examine if a single moment can be flattened or if it must keep circulating through chaos to function.

Commissioned by The SUBSTATION.
