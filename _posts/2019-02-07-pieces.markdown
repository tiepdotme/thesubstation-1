PIECES will showcase bold new contemporary dance works by the next generation of Melbourne's independent choreographers.
 
This December, artists Sarah Aiken, Siobhan McKenna and Geoffrey Watson will present unique and exciting new works in a six-show season at The SUBSTATION. This triple bill will shift our existing notions of dance in unexpected ways by providing resources for artists to challenge their regular practice and execute their most daring ideas.   

PIECES is an evolution of LGI's annual Pieces for Small Spaces, a co-production of LGI and The SUBSTATION supported by the Angior Family Foundation. LGI has also been supported by Creative Victoria, the City of Melbourne and the Australian Government through the Australia Council, its arts funding and advisory body.

Presented by The SUBSTATION and LUCY GUERIN INC.
