[THE VIETNAM ARCHIVE PROJECT](http://www.pthngo.com/vietnam-archive-project) is an ongoing artwork initially starting as a material research project in 2010 in Melbourne. Currently consisting in excess of 5000 items, including slides, photos, film reels and objects. This ever-growing collection has emerged as an act in acquiring and curating found histories and memories that have come to define [PHUONG NGO](http://www.pthngo.com/)'s personal identity of and that of the wider Vietnamese Diaspora that has emerged since the fall of Saigon in 1975.

The materiality of [THE VIETNAM ARCHIVE PROJECT](http://www.pthngo.com/vietnam-archive-project) has been utilised to further extend NGO's practice developing artworks, investigating ways in which history is understood, altered and how personal experiences and inherited memory and experience dictate this.

In the lead up to his 2017 exhibition at THE SUBSTATION, NGO will discuss the archive in depth with JUDE ANDERSON ([PUNCTUM](http://www.punctum.com.au/punctum)), covering various topics including the role of the archive in informing identity; the use of found and vernacular photography in art; and works that have derived from the archive. In conjunction with this key images and items from [THE VIETNAM ARCHIVE PROJECT](http://www.pthngo.com/vietnam-archive-project) will be presented that inform works currently in development.

The forum will take place as part of [HUMAN RIGHTS ARTS AND FILM FESTIVAL](http://2015.hraff.org.au/).
