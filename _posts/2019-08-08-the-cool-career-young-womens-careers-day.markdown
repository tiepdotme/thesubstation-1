The SUBSTATION hosted a career development workshop designed specifically for female students in High School in 2016.

[The Cool Career](http://www.thecoolcareer.com/) is a not-for-profit career guide that inspires girls to follow their dreams, make radical decisions, and leave a positive, but disruptive impact on the world around them.
