Hi-Viz Practice Exchange is a new Chamber Made initiative for women working across performance, sound and music. It's is a day of discussions, exchanges, and interactions aimed at deepening dialogue around cross-artform practice. Hi-Viz is for everyone in this space, from emerging to established artists. Hi-Viz is designed to bring women performance-makers, directors, composers, and sound artists into conversation with one another. The practice exchange is intended to deepen dialogue, build networks, and nurture new understandings between women performance makers, theatre directors, composers, and sound artists.
