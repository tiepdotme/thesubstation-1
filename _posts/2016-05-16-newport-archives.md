[NEWPORT ARCHIVES](http://tamarasaulwick.com/archives/) is an audio walk created for The SUBSTATION, which contemplates the connections between time, place and memory. Inspired by The SUBSTATION building’s own story, the work draws on interviews with local residents to open small windows into a Newport of a different era… an era of ships and trains. Equipped with headphones and an mp3 player as their guide, participants walk unaccompanied through Newport’s streets immersed in a sound world that uncannily knits the present with the past and memory with imagination.

## About the artists

**TAMARA SAULWICK** is a Melbourne based artist who creates interdisciplinary works for theatres and public spaces. Building on over twenty years experience, SAULWICK's individual practice has coalesced in recent years into a singular and compelling voice. Utilising digital, mobile and analogue technologies, with a particular emphasis placed on the role of sound in the live event, her works reflect on how we connect, confront, and negotiate with one another. Her most recent work [ENDINGS](http://tamarasaulwick.com/endings/) premiered in January for The Sydney Festival and was presented at Melbourne’s Arts House in May to critical acclaim, receiving a 2015 Helpmann Award nomination for ‘Best New Australian Work’.
