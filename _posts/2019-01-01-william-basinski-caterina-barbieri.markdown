Join two renowned international composers on a haunting and mesmerising sonic journey. New York based, composer and musician William Basinski performs his only Australian solo performance in a double bill with Berlin-based Italian composer Caterina Barbieri in her first live performance in Australia following appearances at prestigious festivals Berlin Atonal and Unsound (Krakow). These two giants of experimental sound create hypnotic sonic experiences – minimal, mysterious and meditative – using synthesizers and obsolete analogue technologies that will expand your sense of time, space and self.


> **[William Basinski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzcHdxTj00I)** is a classically trained musician and composer who has been working in experimental media for over 30 years in NYC and most recently, California. Employing obsolete technology and analogue tape loops, his haunting and melancholy soundscapes explore the temporal nature of life and resound with the reverberations of memory and the mystery of time.

> **[Caterina Barbieri](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4aH1HGzCUc)** is an Italian composer now based in Berlin. Repetition and pattern permutation lie at the core of her current sonic research. She has composed music for old and new synthesizers as well as for string instruments. By means of synthesis, pattern-based operations and additive canons, her music draws severe geometries in time and space. Her work explores themes of machine intelligence and object-oriented perception in sound through approaching music practice as an integrative cognitive feedback between humans and technology.
