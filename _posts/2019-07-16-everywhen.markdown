EVERYWHEN creates a world of massed percussive objects in perpetual motion, exploring the transience of the physical and psychological structures we create as humans. 
A lone performer inhabits a teeming sonic environment, surrounded by a swarm of hovering objects that move in orbits of up to six meters. Utilizing a large-scale rotational truss structure, the work reveals the power of cyclic motion in sound.

Gongs play themselves as they spin through the space, suspended chimes hum as they ricochet off each other, shells vibrate as they hover through the air and sheets of metal roar as they float in orbital trajectories. Concentric circles of stone and rubble accumulate beneath this shifting canopy of sound, evoking ritual geometries. 

Dense, intricate and mesmerising. The audience is enveloped in a whirlpool of sound, augmented by an immersive rotational lighting system designed by Keith Tucker of Megafun.
