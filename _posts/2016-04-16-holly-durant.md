I am working through a series of developments which are centred around the exploration of image construction and meaning while observing the body – I am particularly focusing on how we observe, build and warp meaning of the female body.

I am looking at how we can mask, evolve and devolve the body live through choreography and strategising the placement and viewpoints of the observer.

I am interested in how we can invert the effects of our natural environments – gravity, momentum, space proximity and textures to rebuild meaning and amplify implied and embedded myths, delving into the deep feminine identity and experience.

I will be exploring both physical and digital manipulation to extrapolate and represent these ideas.
