MASC will be developed as a new live sound and song-based performance work by GIRL. This work asks: How do we forge a sonic template for queerness? How might non-masc bodies exist in that space?

> GIRL is a collaborative performance project led by Jason Sweeney and Em KÃ¶nig. Our collaborators include Jennifer Greer Holmes, Sascha Budimski, Heath Britton and Kerrin Rowlands. We hail from Adelaide (Kaurna Yerta). Beginning life in 2015 as a performance art DJ duo called Winter Witches, GIRL has evolved into a cross-artform music and performance project, focusing on the creation of evocative and immersive sound and song-based live works. We are currently working on a trio of works (Sentients, MASC & Nature) that respond to the links between climate change, ideas of queer masculinities and visions of a queer ecological future.
