**Young Researchers** is a three day Visual Art program for students of Williamstown High school from Years 8, 9 and 10 to be held in August at The SUBSTATION.

The three days of art making will use a range of media particularly drawing, collage, painting and writing. 

Students will work with a practising artist **Hayley Millar-Baker** to create their own work and/or collaborative piece. This immersive program will assist students to extend their artistic skills and experiences.
