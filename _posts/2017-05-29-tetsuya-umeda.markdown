Based in Osaka, Japan, [TETSUYA UMEDA](https://vimeo.com/106567276) creates dynamic environments through the combination of architectural structures, sound and light. His site-specific and temporal works utilise found domestic objects and transform them from their daily familiarity into a transcendent spectacle of the unexpected.

UMEDA’s richly dynamic and embodied installations that are often situated outside of the gallery context, encourage audience members to explore the interaction of its constituent parts, and by doing so, discover their own individuated perceptions, as a part of and in relation to his work.

Presented by The SUBSTATION and LIQUID ARCHITECTURE in association with PERFORMANCE SPACE and ROOM40.
