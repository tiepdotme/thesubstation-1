In August 2016 The SUBSTATION hosted [West Is Best](https://www.westisbest.org/), an annual program for businesses in Melbourneâ€™s West. West Is Best provides a platform for business professionals to meet and network, with the aim of developing excellence in business, innovation and entrepreneurship in the West. 
The focus of this event was a Social Media workshop.
