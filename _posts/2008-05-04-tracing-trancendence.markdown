Look beyond the cities and the headlines and you’ll see that Islam isn’t new in Australia. Tracing back to the mid-1800s, the presence of Islamic cameleers or “Ghans” in outback Australia led to more than just train tracks and the supply of goods across arid rural terrain – the sacred sites and prayer spaces they left behind tell stories that resonate today in contemporary Muslim Australia.

Guided by a strong sense of discipline and tradition, [SHIREEN TAWEEL'S](http://shireentaweel.com/) installation of copper, light and sound charts the history of the country’s mosques. Inspired by remote Australian landscapes and Islamic decorative arts, Taweel’s approach is rooted in cross-cultural dialogue and consideration of sacred and secular spaces. The resulting work is a delicate and meditative intersection of past, present and future.
