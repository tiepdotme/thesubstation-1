[KIM MYHR](http://www.kimmyhr.com/) 12 string guitar <br>

Kim Myhr’s solo performances are hypnotic. At once virtuosic and gestural, the sound world slowly unfolds as harmonics are gradually shifted through minute changes to a continuous strumming pattern. His performances have been described as “an orchestral exploration of the 12-string guitar sounding like something in between American folk strumming and 60s avant-garde soundness orchestral music.” [LISTEN

[TONY BUCK](http://tony-buck.com/) drums and guitar <br>

Tony Buck is one of the most extraordinary musicians Australia has produced. Based in Berlin for over two decades he has made his fame with iconic group, The Necks, which was recently called “the greatest trio on earth” by the New York Times. This concert will present a very rare solo performance by Tony Buck, who has been developing a performance mode that involves drum kit and electric guitar. [WATCH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW6d6DnWiJ0)


[PETER KNIGHT](http://peterknightmusic.com/) trumpet, Revox B77 reel-to-reel, laptop <br>

This is the world premiere live performance of a new piece Peter Knight has created for processed trumpet. Solo for Trumpet, Delays, Tape Loops, and Rice, showcases Peter’s unique approach to the instrument which uses laptop computer, Revox reel-to-reel tape, dropping rice, and multiple speakers to create an immersive experience. [WATCH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WStrnakAJIE)
