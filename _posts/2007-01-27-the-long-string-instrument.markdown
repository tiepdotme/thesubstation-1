[ELLEN FULLMAN](http://ellenfullman.com/) is the creator of the LONG STRING INSTRUMENT, in which rosin-coated fingers brush across dozens of highly tensioned metallic strings, spanning up to thirty metres in length. When played, this stunning and unique instrument produces a chorus of minimal, organ-like overtones. The experience for an audience has been described akin to standing inside an enormous grand piano.  

In Melbourne, FULLMAN will collaborate with acclaimed composer and cellist [THERESA WONG](http://www.theresawong.org/). Together they layer the harmonic possibilities of the cello with the undulating overtones of the LONG STRING INSTRUMENT. FULLMAN and WONG will perform their duet Harbors, drawing from soundscapes, stories and atmospheres that manifest around bodies of water.

Presented by The SUBSTATION and Liquid Architecture in association with Room40.
