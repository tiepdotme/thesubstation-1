[Altona Hockey Club](https://www.altonahc.org.au/) was established in 1932 and has maintained a strong sporting presence in the broader Hobsonâ€™s Bay Community, with the junior players representing over 30 different regional schools. In November 2016 The SUBSTATION hosted a gala event to raise funds for the not-for-profit club.
