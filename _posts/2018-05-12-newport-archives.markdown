NEWPORT ARCHIVES is an audio tour commissioned by The SUBSTATION in 2016, which explores The SUBSTATION’s own building and surrounding landmarks in Newport.  Drawing on interviews with local residents, NEWPORT ARCHIVES explores the origins of Newport and its surrounds. Equipped with headphones and an mp3 player as their guide, participants walk unaccompanied through Newport’s streets in a journey that uncannily knits the present with past memories.

Newport Archives is available by appointment. Email [info@thesubstation.org.au](mailto:info@thesubstation.org.au) to book. Each session runs for 40 minutes.

Audio Design by JOE TALIA.<br>

Commissioned by The SUBSTATION.
