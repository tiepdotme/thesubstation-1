> “Women of the world, take over, because if you don’t the world will come to an end and we haven’t got long.” — IVOR CUTLER and LINDA HIRST

Let us turn to our Lady Examples.

LADY EXAMPLE will begin as a literal and detailed examination of the women who surround us - in our lives, in our city, in our history, in our mythology, in our popular culture. We study these women in forensic detail, analysing and inhabiting their carriage, aura, speech and interactions with socialised space, exploring hidden vulnerabilities and hierarchical power structures at play behind their often two-dimensional legacies. In the studio, our source material will evolve into an original performance aesthetic, proposing a multiplicitous, complex way of being ‘lady’; a ‘total woman’ - who will be able to guide us all forward.

## About Caroline Meaden, Alice Dixon & William Mcbride

ALICE DIXON, CAROLINE MEADEN and WILLIAM MCBRIDE work in a non-hierarchical collaboration as performers and devisers of new unusual contemporary dance-theatre. DIXON and MEADEN have worked together in contemporary dance, performance and film for seven years, with MCBRIDE joining the collaboration in 2013. Their most recent work, THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING was presented as part of Darebin Arts’ Speakeasy program for the 2015 Melbourne Fringe. The work was critically acclaimed, won the Fringe Award for Best Dance, and has been nominated for an Australian Dance Award for Outstanding Achievement in Independent Dance and a Green Room Award for Best Sound. Each artist has an established independent practice, and have worked with many of Australia’s leading performance and dance practitioners. Their collaborative practice is an enquiry at the intersection of dance and theatre that foregrounds rigorous and unusual physicality, inventive writing and spoken delivery, and choreographic performance structures and dramaturgical logics. Their performance works are layer-cakes of form and reference that speak to the complexity of what it feels like to be alive in the current era.
