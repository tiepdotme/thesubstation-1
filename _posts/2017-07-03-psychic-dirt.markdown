Following his work [XFRMR](https://readmanga.tv/archive/xfrmr-mess-live/) presented in 2016 for MELBOURNE FESTIVAL, [ROBBIE THOMSON](http://www.robbiethomson.co.uk/) returns to The SUBSTATION with a series of six panels created specifically for The SUBSTATION billboards. 

PSYCHIC DIRT explores psychedelic tropes, mystical imagery and the paranoid undercurrents of modern life, taking inspiration from a wide range of sources including astronomy, medical imagery, landscape photography, science-fiction and protest posters. 

The work uses high contrast black and white digital collage and hand-cut techniques to create illusionary optical effects and pulsating visual rhythms along the length of the building.

Presented by The SUBSTATION and CRYPTIC.
