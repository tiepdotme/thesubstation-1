[GENESIS BREYER P-ORRIDGE](https://www.facebook.com/Genesis-BREYER-P-ORRIDGE-171735929627691/) sincerely regrets having to cancel their tour due to unexpected complications over the weekend related to their ongoing struggle with chronic leukemia.

Genesis's exhibition LOYALTY DOES NOT END WITH DEATH will still take place at The SUBSTATION from 1 February - 10 March 2018, with the opening night on Thursday 1 February 2018, 6PM.

"We are of course heartbroken that Genesis and Edley will be unable to join us this January for what would have been their first solo visit to Australia. The work Genesis has undertaken, across music and art has been foundational and is a critical intergenerational connection between the countercultures of the mid 20th century and emergent projects around identity, transgression and transcendence in music and art today. We send our very warmest thoughts to them and hope the ongoing therapies are successful in treating their leukaemia. Donations can be made to assist with Genesis's health care costs at www.gofundme.com/genesis-breyer-porridge", says Lawrence English, Room40.

All tickets to Genesis Breyer P-Orridge with Edley ODowd on Friday 2 February will be REFUNDED.

Presented by The SUBSTATION in association with [ROOM 40](http://room40.org/) as part of [MIDSUMMA FESTIVAL](https://midsumma.org.au/)
