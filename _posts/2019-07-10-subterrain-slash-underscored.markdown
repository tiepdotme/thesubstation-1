During the weekend of Open House Melbourne July 27 - 28, The SUBSTATION presents SUBTERRAIN/UNDERSCORED, a free durational dance event created and choreographed by LINDA SASTRADIPRADJA and STUART SHUGG. 

Performances of SUBTERRAIN are UNDERSCORED by dancing that has influenced the lineage of the performers: American Modern and Postmodern dance, traditional Javanese Court dance, and Wayang Kulit performances.
Together, SUBTERRAIN/UNDERSCORED occupies The SUBSTATION's many spaces throughout the OPEN HOUSE weekend, occurring at various times and locations within the building throughout the day, with the passing of time marked by changing natural light states. The audience is invited to experience SUBTERRAIN/UNDERSCORED through these ever-changing perspectives, to freely wander through and around the building as the dancing unfolds, shifting through cycles of daylight.  

Through SUBTERRAIN/UNDERSCORED, SASTRADIPRADJA and  SHUGG will curate spaces within The SUBSTATION'S architecture to provoke a reconsideration of how, when and where it is possible to experience performed work.
