DISCWOMAN has unquestionably changed the political landscape of dance music. Founded by Frankie Decaiza Hutchinson, Emma Burgess-Olson and Christine McCharen-Tran in September 2014, started as a two-day festival at Bossa Nova in New York, Discwoman has grown into a collective, artist agency, and event platform that unapologetically subverts expectations, breaks norms, and amplifies voices of the marginalised. In and outside of the club, they have fearlessly lead the global discourse around gender imbalance on club and festival lineups since their inception in 2014.

COOL ROOM is a collective and event series focused on changing conversations around representation and safety in electronic music, while creating a safer space for marginalised peoples to dance. Across varied sonic terrain, over four years and through parties, panels, and showcases, COOL ROOM has sought to highlight women, gender diverse folk, queers, and people of colour pushing boundaries in their work. Past Cool Room guests have included Steffi, Terre Thaemlitz (AKA DJ Sprinkles), Laurel Halo, and K-HAND.

COOL ROOM makes their debut at The SUBSTATION for a night of fierce, politically-charged techno, with dual international headliners to be announced.
