**Solicitudes** is a collection of works by artist **Lawrence English**, drawn from a wider interrogation into the shifting sonic environment of protest over the past 50 years. 

**Solicitudes** uses pulled images, focusing on the hand as a primary tool (along with voice) for sonic activation during protest. The works also suggest a reading of certain handheld technologies of amplification such as telephones, weapons and instruments. 

**Solicitudes**' images resonate with latent sound; sounds and acoustic spaces that permeate our subconscious, exploding beyond confines of the visual realm. Within each frame sonic spectres manifest, haunting us. 

Presented by The SUBSTATION.
