The confines of a shipping container will become a space for experimentation in The SUBSTATION’s forecourt, as part of HOBSONS BAY CITY COUNCIL’s [ART IN PUBLIC PLACES PROGRAM](https://www.facebook.com/Artinpublicplaces/).

The SUBSTATION’s resident artist, [PLASTIC LOAVES](http://www.plasticloaves.com/) with the artists from print studio [MESH MASH](http://www.meshmashdesign.com.au/) will come together for 4 days of collaboration, culminating in a night of public celebrations, with sounds by Tokyo’s BEANIES.

Presented by [FOOTSCRAY COMMUNITY ARTS CENTRE](http://footscrayarts.com/) in partnership with The SUBSTATION and [WOODS STREET ARTS SPACE](https://www.facebook.com/woodsstreetarts/) and funded by VICTORIA INTERNATIONAL CONTAINER TERMINAL LIMITED (VICT).
