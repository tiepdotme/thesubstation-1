The 2019 Channels Festival, curated by Artistic Director Kelli Alred, will investigate how social, cultural and technological constructs impact individual and collective visibility and agency. 

Australian and international artists have been invited to present works that expand our understanding of history, connectivity, power and place. Examining critical moments of transformation, concepts of community, cultural identity and gender, the festival will present artworks that blur fact with fiction to deconstruct notions of belonging, complicity and resistance.

Channels Festival is pleased to be partnering with The SUBSTATION to present their 2019 festival keynote exhibition.
