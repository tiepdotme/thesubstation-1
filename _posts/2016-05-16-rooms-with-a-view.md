## HOW TO SEE IN MAKING:  
* Should I move fast to catch myself?  
* Should I film my work?  
* Should I come back in the daylight?  
* Should I yell or wave a flag?  
* Should I get someone to stand in for me?  
* Should I crop in?  
* I'll look out the window.  
* A skype tour?  
* Should I get you to hold this for me?

## HOW TO SEE IN VIEWING:  
* Should I carry a map?  
* Should I stay here or walk over there?  
* Should I be watching this from up here?  
* Should I move this or touch this?  
* I'll go down the elevator then up the stairs.  
* I'll squint out the window.

ROOMS WITH A VIEW is a ONE DAY group exhibition held across The Substation that INCLUDES a studio space, dance studio, corridors, staircases, a function room, the foyer, outside of the building and a neighbouring bedroom. The framework for the exhibition is based on the experience of "viewing" with viewers being able to come and go and see multiple installations, movements, performances, photographs and video work simultaneously. Viewers are encouraged to stay for a while, experiencing some works multiple times.
