Visceral and intimate, [ONO](https://www.o-n-o.com.au/) journeys toward a collective understanding of rhythm and sound in the belly of the SUBSTATION.

Room, artists and audience—all form part of the storyline.

As narratives unfold, our response is both sonic and social. Part music performance, part installation— ONO: A Temporary Hearth, will feature American experimentalist BEE MASK [live], Swiss electronic producer AGONIS, Swiss DJ SIMON LEMONT and Melbourne’s own ALBRECHT LA'BROOY [live]. 

Presented by The SUBSTATION and ONO.
