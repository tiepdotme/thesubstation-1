[KIM MYHR](http://www.kimmyhr.com/) takes to the stage with one of Australia’s most distinctive and adventurous contemporary music ensembles the [AUSTRALIAN ART ORCHESTRA](http://www.aao.com.au/), performing the world premiere of a work he created especially for the shape-shifting 10-piece orchestra. Two violinists, two drummers, bass, hammered dulcimer, electronics, bass clarinet, Revox reel-to-reel tape machine and Myhr’s 12-string electric guitar make up the unusual sonic union.

Award-winning young bass clarinet virtuoso, [AVIVA ENDEAN](https://www.avivaendean.com/), incendiary violinist [ERKKI VELTHEIM](http://erkkiveltheim.com/), [TONY BUCK](http://tony-buck.com/) and PETER KNIGHT are amongst the musician line-up.
