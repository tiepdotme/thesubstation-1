[The Salvation Army](https://www.salvationarmy.org.au) is a national not-for-profit charity, dedicated to caring for people and building healthy communities. 

In October 2016 The SUBSTATION hosted the local [Salvation Army Annual Report](https://www.sarmy.org.au/en/Social/vsppu/News/News-Archive-2016/2016-Annual-Report/). To highlight a year of hope through education, collaboration, advocacy, dignity and community, The State Social Command released its first annual report ‘Hope Through Action.’

Over 120 Salvation Army leaders, state sector partners and staff filled The Substation in Newport at the launch of the report, to hear how social services have delivered hope to clients across Victoria.
