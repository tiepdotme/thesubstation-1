[THE RABBLE](http://therabble.com.au/) is developing ULYSSES; an epic, ten-hour contemporary performance inspired by James Joyce’s novel of the same name. THE RABBLE takes our cues from Joyce’s seminal modernist text creating an epic investigation of femininity, death and performance. THE RABBLE’s ULYSSES includes: a woman breast feeding, 309 Questions & 308 Answers, a desperately problematic feminist reading of the narrative events of Ulysses, a meal, a poor theatre version of Hamlet, a slapstick endurance event, a porno, a collective barn dance and a woman saying yes. THE RABBLE are one of our [ARTISTS IN RESIDENCE](http://thesubstation.org.au/show/the-rabble/).
