Over ten days, the [**Art & Industry Festival**](http://artandindustryfestival.com.au) celebrates and investigates the ever-changing industrial and manufacturing heartland of Australia based in Melbourneâ€™s western suburbs. "Industry" as a theme creates a lens through which we can view and acknowledge the past and generate ideas on how we can build and design the future.

**Art & Industry Festival** has partnered with The SUBSTATION for the 2016 program to profile local creators and resources in Hobsons Bay. The area is home to boat builders, craft brewers, designers, oil tanks and treasured heritage buildings. **Art & Industry Festival** is produced and created by Hubcap Productions with its Principal Partner Hobsons Bay City Council.
