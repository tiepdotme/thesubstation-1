In NGATHOONGAN PAWA (WE EAT) – a suite of selected works from the photographic series Cook Book –visual artist HAYLEY MILLAR-BAKER explores the survival, preservation and adaptation of traditional Aboriginal cultural hunting and culinary practices through a range of visual and narrative techniques to examine both the personal and collective realities of Aboriginality and contemporary culture.

> HAYLEY MILLAR-BAKER  is a Gunditjmara woman from Victoria, Australia. Through contemporary approaches to photography, she draws strength from her Gunditjmara bloodlines, history, and the landscape – confronting and crafting past, present, and future stories of South-East Aboriginal existence, and honouring the connectedness of intergenerational experiences of Aboriginality. 

Presented by The SUBSTATION and [YIRRAMBOI Festival](https://yirramboi.net.au/). 
Supported by Creative City Hobsons Bay
