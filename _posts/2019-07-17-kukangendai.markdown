In collaboration with [Melbourne International Arts Festival](https://www.festival.melbourne/) and the [Japan Foundation](https://www.jpf.go.jp/e/index.html), <br> Japanâ€™s avant-garde rock trio [KUKANGENDAI](http://kukangendai.com/) will perform an hour-long musical piece ORGAN as their debut in Australia. The band creates experimental music in live performances by dissecting and reconstructing rhythms and phrases. Their intense and captivating sound will thrill audiences throughout Australia. 

[KUKANGENDAI](http://http://kukangendai.com/) formed in 2006 with JUNYA NOGUCHI on guitar and vocals, KEISUKE KOYANO on bass guitar, and HIDEAKI YAMADA on drums. Their tracks are made through a process of editing, replicating, and deliberate error.  This creates a sense of distortion and places a burden on the performers, leading to their characteristically stoic and humorous live shows. In recent years, the band has attempted to construct and implement a form of live concert in which they go back and forth between playing multiple simultaneous songs in parallel, allowing the flow of time as a whole to manifest as a single unified rhythm.
