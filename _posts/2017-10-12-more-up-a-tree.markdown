[MORE UP A TREE](https://vimeo.com/167341682) is a performance by drummer [JIM WHITE](http://anchorandhope.com/), dancer CLAUDIA DE SERPA SOARES and artist EVE SUSSMAN, that takes place in a 7 x 4m box of 2-way mirrored Plexiglas. At times the audience sees through the glass but the dancer and drummer cannot see out, and at others, the audience can only see themselves reflected back from the mirrored glass.

The performers are alone, in public. This unusual sense of privacy changes their demeanor while the audience takes on an ordained voyeurism, transcending the usual performer-viewer relationship. By doing away with narrative and melody, and making a constantly “in flux” relationship to the public, attention is focused on the agency of the drumming and dancing and the audience. MORE UP A TREE reveals the meaningful nature of movement by removing tonality and concentrating action inside a box.

Presented by The SUBSTATION and [MELBOURNE FESTIVAL](https://www.festival.melbourne/).
