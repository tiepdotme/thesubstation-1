[**Tim Darbyshire**](www.timdarbyshirestudio.com) creates nuanced, dynamic and expansive choreography and performance – 
Drawing from visual, aural, spatial and tactile fields, whilst maintaining the body as a fulcrum. His work circulates around experimental practices, semiotics, architecture, site, body and object specificity. His projects wrestle between deconstructive and subliminal tensions.

He studied Dance at Queensland University of Technology (2003), attended DanceWEB scholarship program (2006 and 2009), completed Formation d'artiste Chorégraphique at Centre National de Danse Contemporaine (France 2006-2007) and obtained a Masters in Performing Arts from Iceland University of the Arts (2018). 

He has presented his work Buckets and Other Things, More or Less Concrete, Stampede the Stampede, Tainted Title and Significant Encounters in a range of contexts including Dance Massive (AU), Keir Choreographic Awards (AU), Campbelltown Arts Centre (AU), Théâtre de la Cité internationale (FR), Dansenhus (NO), Teatro São João (PT), Noorderzon Festival (NL), Zodiak Centre for New Dance (FI), Tanzhaus Zürich (CH) and Reykjavik Dance Festival/Everybody’s Spectacular (IS).
