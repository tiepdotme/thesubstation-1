Melbourne-based artist **Hoda Afsharâ€™s** award-winning portraiture series titled REMAIN was made in collaboration with indefinitely detained asylum seekers on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea more than five years after they left their homelands to seek asylum in Australia. The series bears witness to their incarcerated lives on Manus through individual and shared stories, staged images, and through words.
