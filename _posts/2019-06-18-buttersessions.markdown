The past few years Tokyo based DJ **Haruka** has established himself as one of Japan's top DJs and a crucial figure in the dance music scene. Through his impeccable taste and personalised style of house and techno, **Haruka** has landed himself sets at top tier events around Europe and Japan, including the renowned Labyrinth Festival. 

**Haruka** is returning to Australia in a Melbourne exclusive to play at The SUBSTATION ahead of the release of his debut EP on Butter Sessions.

The "Senko" EP encapsulates everything we loved about his DJ sets - hypnotic, bold and acidic synth sequences paired with masterful live percussion and drumming from Izpon (of Japanese salsa band Banderas) and Shigekazu Otake (of cult group Cro-Magnon) to create a unique sonic space. The recordings snarling nature rejects the pure force of DJ Nobu's Future Terror crew, of which Haruka is a key member.

Supported by a live set by **Tarquin Manek** & **Y-L Hooi **and DJ sets from **Sleep D** and **Jess Sneddon**.
