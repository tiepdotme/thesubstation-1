The SUBSTATION is dedicated to working with the local community through venue hire. The SUBSTATION has a number of hires each year allocated to community bookings that are booked via an application process. Community bookings provide opportunities for The SUBSTATION to engage in activities within their community. 

If you are a local not for profit or community organisation please send through your event proposal including dates, number of guests and the reason for your event to Marisa Fiume on events@thesubstation.org.au
