&lt;p&gt;Loscil aka Scott Morgan from Vancouver derived his name from the “looping oscillator” function of Csound audio programming language. Yet since 2001 Loscil has been making more than just loops – bringing slow ambient textures exploring subjects like water and morning plain – leaving you wrapped in a sonic blanket of euphoria and aural bliss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joining Loscil is one of New Yorks most celebrated ambient music makers, Rafael Anton Irisarri, a multi-instrumentalist, record producer, mastering engineer and curator. Irisarri’s music often has a mournful, elegiac quality, his compositions are deeply emotive and epic, like a symphony recording that’s been rescued from attic entombment after half a century. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tokyo-based electro-acoustic duo Eiko Ishibashi &amp;amp; Joe Talia, performing with flute, piano, analog tape, synthesizers and percussion. Together their work creates a dense harmonic sound world that exists somewhere between avant-garde improvisation and electronic exploration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joining this spectacular line up is Lost Few, an audio-visual project by Melbourne-based experimental artist David Thomson. Lost Few will be debuting Between the Silence – a two person performance installation with visuals by Keith Deverell – showcasing ambient techno, disturbed electronics, processed instrumentation and sub-bass experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event is general standing and relaxed seating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Senko” EP encapsulates everything we loved about his DJ sets - hypnotic, bold and acidic synth sequences paired with masterful live percussion and drumming from Izpon (of Japanese salsa band Banderas) and Shigekazu Otake (of cult group Cro-Magnon) to create a unique sonic space.

&lt;p&gt;Three-time APRA Art Music Award-winning percussionist Claire Edwardes and Helpmann Award-winning dancer Richard Cilli unite their distinct virtuosic talents in an unusual presentation of how movement sounds, and how sound moves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From formal beginnings into virtuosic performance and competitive play, Edwardes and Cilli collaborate with acclaimed director and choreographer Gideon Obarzanek and Australia’s leading electro-pop composer Paul Mac to create an intriguing display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set in the orthodox world of a music and dance recital, the ambiguous relationship between the two performers intensifies. The outcomes are impressive, disturbing and wildly ecstatic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conceptualised as a prequel to last year’s event, ‘Equinox V Venus’, which took place at the theoretical end of humankind’s tenure of planet earth, with this collection REMUSE winds the clock back one billion years to before modern time.
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The runway production MICOLOGÍA elaborates on the cosmic origins of the kingdom of funghi, exploring themes of synchronicity with nature, symbiosis and biomimicry and sustainability through theatrical dialogue and visual display. REMUSE is committed to sustainable and ethical production practices sourcing where possible organic materials.
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a singularly imaginative fashion runway performance timed once again to take place on the new moon preceding the Autumnal equinox.
