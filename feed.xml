&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solicitudes&lt;/strong&gt; uses pulled images, focusing on the hand as a primary tool (along with voice) for sonic activation during protest. The works also suggest a reading of certain handheld technologies of amplification such as telephones, weapons and instruments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solicitudes&lt;/strong&gt;’ images resonate with latent sound; sounds and acoustic spaces that permeate our subconscious, exploding beyond confines of the visual realm. Within each frame sonic spectres manifest, haunting us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Featuring multi-channel video works by London-Istanbul based duo NOOR AFSHAN MIRZA and BRAD BUTLER,  Australian artist REKO RENNIE and Kazakhstani artist ALMAGUL MENLIBAYEYA, the exhibition examines critical moments of social transformation across different eras, cultures and geographies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exhibition sheds light on postcolonial narratives by juxtaposing the work of artists from Australia and central Asia. It brings a personal story – which references a matriarchal Indigenous culture from northern NSW – into dialogue with contemporary feminist perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paying homage to cinematic genres such as the road movie and film noir, the artists draw on cosmology, crash theory, symbolism and myth to address questions about cultural identity, inequality and agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Utilising verbal and non-verbal language systems, the participating artists blend fantasy with fact to inspire fresh perspectives on historical events and their intergenerational implications.&lt;/p&gt;
