&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solicitudes&lt;/strong&gt; uses pulled images, focusing on the hand as a primary tool (along with voice) for sonic activation during protest. The works also suggest a reading of certain handheld technologies of amplification such as telephones, weapons and instruments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solicitudes&lt;/strong&gt;’ images resonate with latent sound; sounds and acoustic spaces that permeate our subconscious, exploding beyond confines of the visual realm. Within each frame sonic spectres manifest, haunting us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Featuring multi-channel video works by London-Istanbul based duo NOOR AFSHAN MIRZA and BRAD BUTLER,  Australian artist REKO RENNIE and Kazakhstani artist ALMAGUL MENLIBAYEYA, the exhibition examines critical moments of social transformation across different eras, cultures and geographies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exhibition sheds light on postcolonial narratives by juxtaposing the work of artists from Australia and central Asia. It brings a personal story – which references a matriarchal Indigenous culture from northern NSW – into dialogue with contemporary feminist perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paying homage to cinematic genres such as the road movie and film noir, the artists draw on cosmology, crash theory, symbolism and myth to address questions about cultural identity, inequality and agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Utilising verbal and non-verbal language systems, the participating artists blend fantasy with fact to inspire fresh perspectives on historical events and their intergenerational implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gongs play themselves as they spin through the space, suspended chimes hum as they ricochet off each other, shells vibrate as they hover through the air and sheets of metal roar as they float in orbital trajectories. Concentric circles of stone and rubble accumulate beneath this shifting canopy of sound, evoking ritual geometries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://http://kukangendai.com/&quot;&gt;KUKANGENDAI&lt;/a&gt; formed in 2006 with JUNYA NOGUCHI on guitar and vocals, KEISUKE KOYANO on bass guitar, and HIDEAKI YAMADA on drums. Their tracks are made through a process of editing, replicating, and deliberate error.  This creates a sense of distortion and places a burden on the performers, leading to their characteristically stoic and humorous live shows. In recent years, the band has attempted to construct and implement a form of live concert in which they go back and forth between playing multiple simultaneous songs in parallel, allowing the flow of time as a whole to manifest as a single unified rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;
