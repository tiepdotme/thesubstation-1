&lt;p&gt;Cast over two of The SUBSTATION’s arched windows, &lt;strong&gt;Current&lt;/strong&gt; is a video projection piece by &lt;strong&gt;Pierra Van Sparkes&lt;/strong&gt;. Informed by The SUBSTATION’s past of providing electricity and transportation, &lt;strong&gt;Current&lt;/strong&gt; contemplates the history and architecture of the site, linking it with the artist’s experience of cycle and connection, past and place. We follow a line of light, looped around and between trees surrounding the artist’s family home: mimicking childhood circuits between Mum and Nan’s house, and marking renewed movements in the space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by The SUBSTATION and &lt;a href=&quot;https://melbournefringe.com.au/event/current/&quot;&gt;Melbourne Fringe Festival.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;about-pierra-van-sparkes&quot;&gt;About Pierra Van Sparkes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Pierra Van Sparkes is a Kulin country-based Pibbulman artist. Her work is inspired by the shared history, feelings and encounters that shape lived experiences of Aboriginality amidst a diverse range of Indigenous identities. Working with photography, video and digital media, she interrogates the mythscapes that inform notions of Indigenous authenticity, settler-colonial supremacy and the modes in which they manifest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Her work has featured in shows including disrupt, Hamer Hall (2019); Taking it Blak, Center For Contemporary Photography (2019); Blak to the Future, Footscray Community Arts Centre (2018); BBQ: Blak, Beautiful and Queer, (In)Visible (2018); Hitched, Wyndham Art Gallery (2019); and The Koorie Art Show, Koorie Heritage Trust (2016/17), taking home the 2016 RMIT University Award and the 2017 Moogji Club People’s Choice Award.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solicitudes&lt;/strong&gt; uses pulled images, focusing on the hand as a primary tool (along with voice) for sonic activation during protest. The works also suggest a reading of certain handheld technologies of amplification such as telephones, weapons and instruments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solicitudes&lt;/strong&gt;’ images resonate with latent sound; sounds and acoustic spaces that permeate our subconscious, exploding beyond confines of the visual realm. Within each frame sonic spectres manifest, haunting us. &lt;/p&gt;
