&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hi-Viz&lt;/strong&gt; is for women and non-binary artists working across performance, sound and music. It is for everyone in this space, from emerging to established artists. &lt;strong&gt;Hi-Viz&lt;/strong&gt; is designed to bring performance-makers, directors, composers, and sound artists into conversation with one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst there are many artists working in these crossover spaces, there are few opportunities outside of the framework of producing work, to gather and interrogate this area of practice. Each artform discipline brings with it quite distinct languages, skills, processes, conventions and expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hi-Viz Practice Exchange&lt;/strong&gt; aims to begin conversations to unpack these differences in the hope of developing a richer understanding of the possibilities of cross-artform practice. Importantly, it is also a day for practitioners from the often quite discrete scenes of contemporary performance/theatre, sound art, and new/art music to meet one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day one is a day of presentations, practice interrogation, networking and art dates. Day two is a day of hands-on, interactive workshops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by The SUBSTATION and &lt;a href=&quot;www.chambermade.org&quot;&gt;Chamber Made.&lt;/a&gt; This event has been supported by the Helen Macpherson Smith Trust.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Callum Flack Design</name></author><summary type="html">Artists involved include Liza Lim, Cat Hope, Roslyn Oades, Madeleine Flynn, Carolyn Connors, Gian Slater, Kate Sulan and more to come.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://thesubstation.org.au/uploads/HiVisHeroImage.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">SUBTERRAIN/ UNDERSCORED</title><link href="https://thesubstation.org.au/whats-on/subterrain-slash-underscored/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="SUBTERRAIN/

&lt;p&gt;Performances of SUBTERRAIN are UNDERSCORED by dancing that has influenced the lineage of the performers: American Modern and Postmodern dance, traditional Javanese Court dance, and Wayang Kulit performances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together SUBTERRAIN/UNDERSCORED occupies The SUBSTATION’s many spaces, occurring at various times and locations within the building throughout the day. The audience is invited to experience SUBTERRAIN/UNDERSCORED through these ever-changing perspectives, to freely wander through and around the building as the dancing unfolds, shifting through and interacting with the cycles of natural daylight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through SUBTERRAIN/UNDERSCORED, SASTRADIPRADJA and  SHUGG will curate spaces within The SUBSTATION’s architecture to provoke a reconsideration of how, when and where it is possible to experience performed work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UNDERSCORED will be danced throughout the day with performances of SUBTERRAIN starting at 12pm and 3pm daily.
The SUBSTATION will be open for public access from 11am - 5pm daily.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Callum Flack Design</name></author><summary type="html">During the weekend of Open House Melbourne, The SUBSTATION presents SUBTERRAIN/UNDERSCORED, a free durational dance event created and choreographed by LINDA SASTRADIPRADJA and STUART SHUGG.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://thesubstation.org.au/uploads/subterrain-underscored.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Community bookings</title><link href="https://thesubstation.org.au/community/community-bookings/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Community bookings" /><published>2019-06-26T13:11:00+10:00</published><updated>2019-06-26T13:11:00+10:00</updated><id>https://thesubstation.org.au/community/community-bookings</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://thesubstation.org.au/community/community-bookings/">&lt;p&gt;The SUBSTATION is dedicated to working with the local community through venue hire.

&lt;p&gt;Loscil aka Scott Morgan from Vancouver derived his name from the “looping oscillator” function of Csound audio programming language. Yet since 2001 Loscil has been making more than just loops – bringing slow ambient textures exploring subjects like water and morning plain – leaving you wrapped in a sonic blanket of euphoria and aural bliss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joining Loscil is one of New Yorks most celebrated ambient music makers, Rafael Anton Irisarri, a multi-instrumentalist, record producer, mastering engineer and curator. Irisarri’s music often has a mournful, elegiac quality, his compositions are deeply emotive and epic, like a symphony recording that’s been rescued from attic entombment after half a century. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tokyo-based electro-acoustic duo Eiko Ishibashi &amp;amp; Joe Talia, performing with flute, piano, analog tape, synthesizers and percussion. Together their work creates a dense harmonic sound world that exists somewhere between avant-garde improvisation and electronic exploration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joining this spectacular line up is Lost Few, an audio-visual project by Melbourne-based experimental artist David Thomson. Lost Few will be debuting Between the Silence – a two person performance installation with visuals by Keith Deverell – showcasing ambient techno, disturbed electronics, processed instrumentation and sub-bass experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event is general standing and relaxed seating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pack a cushion, or grab one provided and snuggle down for a night of high fidelity storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part performance, part installation, ONO creates a platform for music most often reserved for private enjoyment. Ambient and experimental sounds flow freely via communal conditions of warmth, comfort and intimacy between listener and performer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often intense but always rewarding, room, artist and audience all form part of the instrument.&lt;/p&gt;
