&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solicitudes&lt;/strong&gt; uses pulled images, focusing on the hand as a primary tool (along with voice) for sonic activation during protest. The works also suggest a reading of certain handheld technologies of amplification such as telephones, weapons and instruments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solicitudes&lt;/strong&gt;’ images resonate with latent sound; sounds and acoustic spaces that permeate our subconscious, exploding beyond confines of the visual realm. Within each frame sonic spectres manifest, haunting us. &lt;/p&gt;
