                    <p>Director and choreographer LEE SERLE melds audience and artist in the interactive, immersive and participatory performance piece MULTIMODAL, occupying THE SUBSTATION from August 30 - September 4.</p>

<p>MULTIMODAL guides randomly selected audience members through a series of physical, sonic, olfactory and choreographic experiences housed within The SUBSTATION’s various post-industrial spaces.</p>

<p>Those selected, contribute to the work’s unfolding content as they journey through BYRON SCULLIN’s visceral sonic experiences, physical movement spaces and immersive, scent laden installations from visual artist LIZ HENDERSON and LEE SERLE <strong>,</strong> eliciting memories and personal narratives throughout the performance ritual.</p>

<p>Performers DEANNE BUTTERWORTH, BENJAMIN HANCOCK, GEOFFREY WATSON and REBECCA JENSEN, together with eight guides, lead the inductees through the installation series - blurring the lines between performer and audience, and public and private space, as the ritual’s voyeurs (the audience) observe their performance induction from afar.</p>

<h2 id="about-the-artists">About the artists</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.leeserle.com/"><strong>LEE SERLE</strong></a> is a New York and Melbourne based choreographer, performer and teacher. He creates work in varied contexts and forms; including dances for the stage, site-specific, interactive performance installations, and intimate solo works. SERLE has been commissioned to create new works for the Lyon Opera Ballet, Sydney Dance Company, Rolex Mentor and Protégé Arts Initiative, Lucy Guerin Inc., Australian Centre for Contemporary Art (ACCA), Dancenorth, Next Wave, and the Victorian College of the Arts presenting new work in Australia, USA, France and Lebanon.</p>

<p>SERLE was Protégé in Dance for the prestigious Rolex Mentor and Protégé Arts Initiative 2010-11; mentored by seminal American choreographer Trisha Brown in New York. Through this initiative he created and performed new work with the company, and toured within the USA and internationally. It was through this initiative Lee’s first major work ‘P.O.V.’ was commissioned and presented at the New York Public Library. An inaugural recipient of the Australia Council for the Arts, Creative Australia Fellowship in 2012, SERLE embarked on a research and development period for 2 years of solo choreographic practice in Melbourne, New York and Beirut; Mentored by Tere O’Connor (New York). Following this he was an artist in residence at ACCA, culminating in his solo work 60 Second Dances, for the Framed Movements exhibition for the 2014 Melbourne Festival.</p>

<p><strong>BYRON SCULLIN.</strong> The work of Melbourne practitioner <a href="http://www.byronscullin.com/">BYRON SCULLIN</a> explores the technological representation and amplification of sound as well as its properties as a physical presence. Operating in an ambiguous space where sound transitions into noise, SCULLIN’s sonic environments offer an experience of mass and multiplicity, often representing attempts to hear the unhearable.</p>

<p>After an interest in synthesis at a young age, SCULLIN was mentored by producer and composer Francois Tetaz. He has since been involved in almost all aspects of audio in his twenty year career, contributing sound to feature films such as Wolf Creek, contemporary dance productions by Lucy Guerin, Gideon Obarzanek, and Lee Serle, and theatre works by David Chisholm, Chamber Made Opera, and Arena Theatre Co. He also works as a sound educator at RMIT and Melbourne University. A prolific collaborator, SCULLIN has worked closely with audio-visual artist Robin Fox and video artist Daniel Crooks, as well as Australian composers Anthony Pateras, Marco Fusinato, and Oren Ambarchi. He’s also helped realise sound for notable international artists including Bernard Parmegiani, Tony Conrad, and Steven O’Malley.</p>

<p><a href="http://hancockbenjamin.tumblr.com/"><strong>BENJAMIN HANCOCK</strong></a> is a young Melbourne-based dancer and choreographer.

<p><a href="(http://www.deannebutterworth.com)"><strong>DEANNE BUTTERWORTH.</strong></a> A graduate of Western Australian Academy for Performing Arts, DEANNE BUTTERWORTH’s choreographic practice presently focusses on collaboration with other artists and working in outdoor spaces in proximity to existing sculptural works.</p>

<p>In 2012 she collaborated with artist Linda Tegg and other performers to create a site specific work at a convenience store, titled PERFORMANCE. In 2014 BUTTERWORTH worked with artist Ash Kilmartin for the exhibition at Slopes, Fitzroy If This Exhibition Were A Text to perform the work Regarding Yesterday, by Brussels based dancer and choreographer, Adva Zakai. She performed in Intermission by Maria Hassabi and was involved in Alicia Frankovich’s work, Defending Plural Experiences, both shown at ACCA; she also performed in Entitled Title, by Tim Darbyshire for the inaugural Keir Choreographic Award and was a participant in Shelley Lasica’s ANAT Residency.

<p><a href="http://www.geofferygeoffreygeoffrey.com"><strong>GEOFFREY WATSON</strong></a> is a Melbourne-based performing artist whose work is rooted in but not tied to; dance, choreographic, wearable design and writing practices. WATSON is a graduate of the Australian Ballet School, was trained in design under the tutelage of Melbourne couturier Maximilan, and did not complete high school.</p>

<p>WATSON has worked nationally and internationally as a performer and designer for artists including; Nana Biluš Abaffy (multiple works with Abaffy’s experimental performance groups Psychoknot Theatrics and Secretive Dance Team), Phiilip Adams BalletLab (Performance Intervention for Saint Sebastian and Aviary, 2014), Dark Mofo (Blacklist party 2015), Brooke Stamp (designer for Tearaway Part 1, 2014) and Tokyo-based theatre company Gekidan Kaitaisha (Infant, 2013). WATSON’s own work attempts to further confound the already confusing landscapes of art, history and the mind. These performances include; Loving You Ad Nauseum- a TOTAL melodrama struggle against the Love/Beauty paradigm (premiering 2016), Australian Suburban Living Project- a figure displaced amongst unstable, abstracted memories of an Australian suburban childhood (2014), and Camel - a heroic bleeding of dogmatic displays of art-forms into and against one another.</p>
