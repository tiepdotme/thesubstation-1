Engaging with personal subjects surrounding her existence as an ‘urbanised’ Koori, [HAYLEY MILLAR-BAKER](http://www.hayleymillar.net/)'s practice is focused in photo-media investigations and interrogations of both personal and collective realities and re-imaginings - confronting past, present, and future stories of Aboriginal existence within south-east Australia.

Hayley explores themes of Indigenous cultural beliefs, connection to Country, land, flora, and fauna, cultural practices, knowledges, and values, Aboriginal placement and identity, and south-east Australian history, all in relation to her own Aboriginal heritage.

Hayley was awarded the Special Commendation Award for the Churchie National Emerging Art Prize at QUT Art Museum (2017), and has been a finalist in the 65th Blake Prize (2018), Darebin Art Prize (2017), Incinerator Art Award: Art for Social Change (2017), Pro Hart Outback Art Prize (2017), Maddocks Art Prize (2017), Victorian Indigenous Art Award (2014). 

Hayley has also exhibited as part of the 2018 Sydney Festival, 2017 TARNANTHI: Festival of Contemporary Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art, 2017 HoBiennale, 2017 Ballarat International Foto Biennale, and the 2017 Yirramboi Festival.

Hayley completed a Bachelor of Fine Arts (Painting) at RMIT University (2010), Master of Teaching (Visual Arts) at The University of Melbourne (2015), and a Master of Fine Arts at RMIT University (2017).
